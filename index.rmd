## Plan for our little analysis

We will demo: 

- data visualization with `ggplot2`
- reproducible reports with RMarkdown
- version control with Git and GitHub
- publishing our report as a website!!!

Data:

We'll be using data from the National Park Service: Annual Visitation by Park from 1979-2017. <https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/National>.


## Setup information and code

We'll clearly identify the requirements to do this analysis: R packages and data sources.

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## load libraries
library(tidyverse)

## import data
np_visit <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/data-vis/master/np_visit.csv")
```

## Explore National Parks in California

I know these data are already tidy, so we can subset the data we want to explore and visualize it

```{r ca national parks}
## first filter National Parks in California
np_ca <- np_visit %>% # introduce pipe operator?
  filter(type == "National Park" & state == "CA")

## and now scatter plot
ggplot(data = np_ca, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = park_name))

## and now box plot
ggplot(data = np_ca, aes(x = park_name, y = visitors)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = park_name))
```

## Let's add a photo
